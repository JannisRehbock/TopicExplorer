strong quantitative support_isLinkIsLink_
 for the theory that all 
living organisms on Earth_isLinkIsLink_
 are descended from a

Charles Darwin_isLinkIsLink_
 proposed the theory of universal common descent through an 
evolution_isLinkIsLink_
 process in 
On the Origin of Species_isLinkIsLink_
, twice stating the hypothesis that there was only one progenitor for all life forms and ending with "There is a grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one".
 The theory asserts that all currently living organisms on Earth share a common genetic heritage with each being the descendant from a single original species, though the suggestion of substantial 
horizontal gene transfer_isLinkIsLink_
 during early evolution has led to questions about 
monophyly_isLinkIsLink_
 of life.
The 
last universal ancestor_isLinkIsLink_
 (LUA) (also called the last universal common ancestor, LUCA), that is, the 
most recent common ancestor_isLinkIsLink_
 of all currently living organisms,
 is believed to have appeared about 
3.9 billion years ago_isLinkIsLink_

History_isSectionCaptionisSectionCaption__hasLevel2hasLevel_
In the 1740s, 
Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis_isLinkIsLink_
 made the first known suggestion in a series of essays that all organisms may have had a common ancestor, and that they had diverged through random variation and 
natural selection_isLinkIsLink_
 In 
Essai de Cosmologie_isCursiveIsCursive_
, Maupertuis noted:
Could one not say that, in the fortuitous combinations of the productions of nature, as there must be some characterized by a certain relation of fitness which are able to subsist, it is not to be wondered at that this fitness is present in all the species that are currently in existence? Chance, one would say, produced an innumerable multitude of individuals; a small number found themselves constructed in such a manner that the parts of the animal were able to satisfy its needs; in another infinitely greater number, there was neither fitness nor order: all of these latter have perished. Animals lacking a mouth could not live; others lacking reproductive organs could not perpetuate themselves ... The species we see today are but the smallest part of what blind destiny has produced ...
In 1790, 
Immanuel Kant_isLinkIsLink_
 wrote in 
Kritik der Urtheilskraft_isCursiveIsCursive_
 (
Critique of Judgement_isLinkIsLink_
) that the analogy of animal forms implies a common original type, and thus a common parent.
In 1795, Charles Darwin's grandfather, 
Erasmus Darwin_isLinkIsLink_
, asked:

[W]ould it be too bold to imagine, that in the great length of time, since the earth began to exist, perhaps millions of ages before the commencement of the history of mankind, would it be too bold to imagine, that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which 
 endued with animality, with the power of acquiring new parts attended with new propensities, directed by irritations, sensations, volitions, and associations; and thus possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down those improvements by generation to its posterity, world without end?
In 1859, Charles Darwin's 
The Origin of Species_isCursiveIsCursive_
 was published. The views about common descent expressed therein were that it was possible that there was only one progenitor for all life forms.
"Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed." 
 (p 484)
Darwin's famous closing sentence describes the "grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one."
 (p 490)

Evidence of universal common descent_isSectionCaptionisSectionCaption__hasLevel2hasLevel_

Common biochemistry and genetic code_isSectionCaptionisSectionCaption__hasLevel3hasLevel_
All known forms of life are based on the same fundamental biochemical organisation: genetic information encoded in 
DNA_isLinkIsLink_
, transcribed into RNA, through the effect of protein- and RNA-
enzyme_isLinkIsLink_
, then translated into 
protein_isLinkIsLink_
 by (highly similar) ribosomes, with ATP, NADPH and others as energy sources, etc. Furthermore, the 
genetic code_isLinkIsLink_
 (the "translation table" according to which DNA information is translated into proteins) is nearly identical for all known lifeforms, from 
bacteria_isLinkIsLink_
 and 
archaea_isLinkIsLink_
 to 
animal_isLinkIsLink_
 and 
plant_isLinkIsLink_
. The universality of this code is generally regarded by biologists as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent. Analysis of the small differences in the genetic code has also provided support for universal common descent. An example would be 
Cytochrome c_isLinkIsLink_
 which most organisms actually share. 
 A statistical comparison of various alternative hypotheses has shown that universal common ancestry is significantly more probable than models involving multiple origins.

Selectively neutral similarities_isSectionCaptionisSectionCaption__hasLevel4hasLevel_
Similarities which have no adaptive relevance cannot be explained by convergent evolution, and therefore they provide compelling support for the theory of universal common descent.
Such evidence has come from two areas: amino acid sequences and DNA sequences. Proteins with the same three-dimensional structure need not have identical 
amino acid_isLinkIsLink_
 sequences; any irrelevant similarity between the sequences is evidence for common descent. In certain cases, there are several 
codon_isLinkIsLink_
 (DNA triplets) that code for the same amino acid. Thus, if two species use the same codon at the same place to specify an amino acid that can be represented by more than one codon, that is evidence for a recent common ancestor.

Other similarities_isSectionCaptionisSectionCaption__hasLevel4hasLevel_
The universality of many aspects of cellular life is often pointed to as supportive evidence to the more compelling evidence listed above. These similarities include the energy carrier 
adenosine triphosphate_isLinkIsLink_
 (ATP), and the fact that all amino acids found in proteins are left-handed. It is, however, possible that these similarities resulted because of the laws of physics and chemistry, rather than universal common descent and therefore resulted in 
convergent evolution_isLinkIsLink_

Phylogenetic trees_isSectionCaptionisSectionCaption__hasLevel3hasLevel_

Another important piece of evidence is that it is possible to construct detailed 
phylogenetic tree_isLinkIsLink_
 (that is, "genealogic trees" of species) mapping out the proposed divisions and common ancestors of all living species. In 2010 an analysis of available genetic data, mapping them to phylogenetic trees, gave "firm quantitative support for the unity of life. ...there is now strong quantitative support, by a formal test,
 for the unity of life.
  It should be noted, however, the 'formal' test is criticised
 for not including consideration of 
convergent evolution_isLinkIsLink_
, and Theobald has defended the method against this claim.
Traditionally, these trees have been built using morphological methods, such as appearance, 
embryology_isLinkIsLink_
, etc. Recently, it has been possible to construct these trees using molecular data, based on similarities and differences between genetic and protein sequences. All these methods produce essentially similar results, even though most 
genetic variation_isLinkIsLink_
 has no influence over external morphology. That phylogenetic trees based on different types of information agree with each other is strong evidence of a real underlying common descent.

Artificial selection_isSectionCaptionisSectionCaption__hasLevel3hasLevel_
Artificial selection_isLinkIsLink_
 demonstrates the diversity that can exist among organisms that share a relatively recent common ancestor. In artificial selection, one species is bred selectively at each generation, allowing only those organisms that exhibit desired characteristics to reproduce. These characteristics become increasingly well-developed in successive generations. Artificial selection was successful long before science discovered the genetic basis.

The 
Chihuahua_isLinkIsLink_

 illustrate the range of sizes among dog breeds.

Dog breeding_isSectionCaptionisSectionCaption__hasLevel4hasLevel_

The diversity of domesticated 
dog_isLinkIsLink_
 is an example of the power of artificial selection. All breeds share common ancestry, having descended from 
wolves_isLinkIsLink_
. Humans selectively bred them to enhance specific characteristics, such as color and length or body size. This created a range of breeds that include the 
Chihuahua_isLinkIsLink_
, 
Great Dane_isLinkIsLink_
, 
Basset Hound_isLinkIsLink_
, 
Pug_isLinkIsLink_
, and 
Poodle_isLinkIsLink_
. Wild wolves, which did not undergo artificial selection, are relatively uniform in comparison.

Wild cabbage_isSectionCaptionisSectionCaption__hasLevel4hasLevel_
Image:Brassica oleracea0.jpg_isPicture1IsPicture1_
Wild Cabbage plant

Early farmers cultivated many popular vegetables from the 
Brassica oleracea_isLinkIsLink_
 (wild cabbage) by artificially selecting for certain attributes. Common vegetables such as 
cabbage_isLinkIsLink_
, 
kale_isLinkIsLink_
, 
broccoli_isLinkIsLink_
, 
cauliflower_isLinkIsLink_
, 
kohlrabi_isLinkIsLink_
 and 
Brussels sprouts_isLinkIsLink_
 are all descendants of the wild cabbage plant.
 Brussels sprouts were created by artificially selecting for large 
bud_isLinkIsLink_
 size. Broccoli was bred by selecting for large 
flower_isLinkIsLink_
 stalks. Cabbage was created by selecting for short 
petioles_isLinkIsLink_
. Kale was bred by selecting for large 
leaves_isLinkIsLink_
.



Natural selection_isSectionCaptionisSectionCaption__hasLevel3hasLevel_

Darwin's finches

Natural selection is the evolutionary process by which 
heritable_isLinkIsLink_
 traits that increase an individual's fitness become more common, and heritable traits that decrease an individual's fitness become less common.



Darwin's finches_isSectionCaptionisSectionCaption__hasLevel4hasLevel_

During 
Charles Darwin_isLinkIsLink_
's studies on the 
Galápagos Islands_isLinkIsLink_
, Darwin observed 13 species of 
finches_isLinkIsLink_
 that are closely related and differ most markedly in the shape of their 
beak_isLinkIsLink_
. The beak of each 
species_isLinkIsLink_
 is suited to the food available in its particular environment, suggesting that beak shapes evolved by 
natural selection_isLinkIsLink_
. Large beaks were found on the islands where the primary source of food for the finches are 
nuts_isLinkIsLink_
 and therefore the large beaks allowed the birds to be better equipped for opening the nuts and staying well nourished. Slender beaks were found on the finches which found 
insect_isLinkIsLink_
 to be the best source of food on the island they inhabited; their slender beaks allowed the birds to be better equipped for pulling out the insects from their tiny hiding places. The finch is also found on the main land and it is thought that they 
migrated_isLinkIsLink_
 to the islands and began 
adapting_isLinkIsLink_
 to their environment through 
natural selection_isLinkIsLink_
